                We believe in the Holy Bible, comprising both the Old and New
                Testaments as the inspired word of God of which the New does not
                condemn the Old, but the fulfilment of the latter. We believe
                that the bloodshed, death and resurrection of our Lord and
                Saviour Jesus Christ for the reconciliation of man to God, is a
                foundation which the conquest over death and hell by Christ for
                mankind is based

              <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Our Vision</h2>
              <p class="animate-on-scroll animate-delay-100">
                Our vision is to preach the undiluted and or the uncompromised
                word of God to all mankind that they would be saved. To help the
                poor and needy by way of empowerment through the provision of
                physical, financial and spiritual assistance where applicable
              </p>

              <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Background of Ministry</h2>
              <p class="animate-on-scroll animate-delay-100">
                In 2003, Christ the King Evangelical Ministry was Established at
                quarry, back of hotel 510, in a make-shift school compound
                paying a rent of 300 Leones per annum to the Proprietor of the
                school. Quarry was a large establishment in the North west
                corner of Freetown, with a large Muslim population and other
                faiths. There was a large group of fetish priests, herbalists
                and Juju mongers in the said community. The practice of
                Christianity became a threat to all other practitioners of faith
                and we were considered enemies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The battle became so strong that the Muslim clerics announced
                that no land should be sold to us in Quarry. The president of
                the Herbalists and all Fetish priests Association bought the
                make shift school, where we were holding services and we were
                driven from the school. Somebody gave us an unfinished unroofed
                house where we kept services. We used tarpaulins to cover part
                of the structure from the rain during services
              </p>
              <p>
                Shortly after these events, my office, the Bank of Sierra Leone,
                sent me to Boulder, Colorado, USA for two months to study
                supervision of Micro Finance Banks and other financial
                Institutions. It was there I met a man whom I have never known,
                a man with the heart of God, a white American Citizen, Mr. Leon
                Palmer. This Man drove us in his car to our university residence
                and invited us to his house for dinner. We exchanged contacts
                and after my return to Sierra Leone, I explained to him all that
                had befallen the church. He asked me, “What do you want me to
                do?” I told him I needed tarpaulins and sticks to put up a
                makeshift church. This man sent USD4,810 at intervals and we
                were able to build the present church in addition to our own
                resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, we were outwitted by a Judas who purported to be a
                pastor in the church. He came to the church when I was in
                America, and seeing our plight he announced that his
                father-in-law had land which we can use to build our church. I
                announced to the church that I have received 4,810 dollars for
                our church. I had a genuine motive but this pastor had a wrong
                motive. Agreement was reached for me to sacrifice one town plot
                of land I had in West end of Freetown for their plot of land in
                quarry, where we should build the church. It was an oral
                agreement and believing that we were all Christians, it should
                be a reliable agreement. No sooner had we bought all the
                materials and assembled them at the site, than the pastor and
                his father-in-law changed their minds. They said the land was
                for lease. Sadly, we agreed because we could not take the sand,
                the blocks and the other materials back and we had no place for
                storage. Up till now we are paying lease rent for a church house
                we have built. In 2025, the lease rent was astronomically
                increased from 2,000 Leones per annum to Le10,000 per annum
                otherwise we were to be evicted. So, to God be the glory. Our
                goal is to buy our own land and build our own church, hence an
                appeal to donors and philanthropists.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the year 2009, we changed the name of the Church from Christ
                the King Family to The Trumpet of God Evangelical Ministry by
                the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit to properly align with our
                vision based on the scripture in 1st Thessalonians 4:16. It was
                in Line with the Lords call for end times messages to prepare
                the minds of people for the coming of the Lord.
              </p>

              <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Welfare</h2>
              <p class="animate-on-scroll animate-delay-100">
                We cater for the welfare of our members who are vulnerable in
                specific areas. We cater for coffins, support weddings to avoid
                co-habitations, help with business capital where extremely
                necessary to salvage devoted but disadvantaged members,
                particularly widows and or orphans, or the physically
                challenged. We also help with medical bills where genuinely
                necessary. Finally, we maintain a counselling session where
                advises and disputes are amicably settled
              </p>
              <p>
                We extend helping hands to the less fortunate in the church,
                help to pay school and college fees to some students, and of
                late we are thinking of school dropouts and drug related
                consequences through counselling and rehab facilities. This
                would require external assistance by way of donors and well
                wishers
              </p>

              <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Our Goals For 2026 - 2030</h2>
              <p class="animate-on-scroll animate-delay-100">
                For 2026, we would like to support 20 students in technical and
                vocational colleges pursuing technical qualifications in
                Building and construction courses, Electrical and electronic
                engineering, Plumbing, Refrigerator engineering, civil
                engineering, carpentry, automobile engineering all at
                certificate and Diploma levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would also like to help 40 vulnerable widows with average
                capital for small and medium enterprises.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would also like to support 40 orphans in primary and
                secondary schools. Support depends on the availability of funds.
                We may include pictures of widows and orphans at their
                discretion, on our web page to solicit funds from
                philanthropists and well-wishers who would like to support
                vulnerable people. Such funds are strictly controlled by our
                church to avoid abuse, misuse and or scamming.

              <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">MICRO FINANCE WINDOW</h3>
              <p>
                We have organized a micro finance window strictly for
                economically active poor church members at least for now. WE
                shall be relying on donors and philanthropists to provide seed
                capital for this venture. Fortunately, the General Overseer is a
                Boulder trained MFI and MF bank specialist and at one time head
                of Micro Finance Unit at Bank of Sierra Leone
